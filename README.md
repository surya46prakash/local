In a small village nestled by the sea, a young girl named Lyra lived with her grandmother, a weaver of stories. Each night, by the warmth of the hearth, her grandmother would tell tales of the ocean's depths and the creatures who roamed beneath the waves.

One evening, Lyra asked, “Grandma, do you think the sea could ever tell its own story?”

Her grandmother smiled gently. “Perhaps it does, in its own way. But you must listen closely.”

That night, as the moonlight danced on the water, Lyra slipped out of bed and walked to the shore. The tide whispered secrets, pulling her closer. She knelt, her fingers brushing the cool waves, and suddenly, she heard a voice. It was soft, like a forgotten lullaby.

“Listen carefully,” the sea said. “I am ancient, older than the stars. I have seen empires rise and fall, witnessed the birth of islands and the sinking of cities. My songs are carried by the wind, my memories are etched in the sands.”

Lyra gasped. “Why are you telling me this?”

The sea’s voice was like a sigh. “Because you are the first to truly listen.”

The next morning, Lyra shared her story with her grandmother, who smiled knowingly. “The sea speaks to those who are willing to hear. It chose you, my dear.”

From then on, Lyra spent her days by the water, listening. The sea had many tales to tell—of forgotten treasures, of lost sailors, and of dreams that washed ashore. And in return, Lyra gave the sea a voice, weaving its stories into her own.
